# epic-weather-app
## Description
Don't you hate it when you decide to go for a walk, but it suddenly starts raining and you didn't even bring your umbrella? Or when you decide to go to the beach, but you weren't expecting the temperature to be ''this'' cold? It doesn't have to be this way; that's where the Weather App comes in!
### Why did I make this?
I wanted people to have a reliable weather app so that they don't run into any weather-related the current day, or on future days, either.
### What problem does this solve?
This keeps everyone in the know about the current weather in their area.
### What did I learn?
I learned what an application programming interface (API) is and how I can use API keys to insert information about a particular city. Not only that, but I also learned how to format the date and time so that they are consistent with the user's time zone.
